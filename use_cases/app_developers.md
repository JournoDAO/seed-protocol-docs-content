# App developers

Seed Protocol reopens a door that's been closing for a decade: building on genuinely open infrastructure. When you integrate with Seed Protocol, you're surfacing content from writers, researchers, and creators that's stored on permanent, decentralized infrastructure—content that won't disappear when a company pivots, an API gets deprecated, or a platform decides to wall off its garden. Your app can interact with a growing corpus of human knowledge that persists by design.

The protocol enables a fundamentally different relationship with user data. Because users can own their identity and content through Ethereum attestations and decentralized storage, you can build applications that never collect or store personal information. No user databases means no GDPR compliance burden, no breach liability, no painful data deletion requests. You focus purely on the experience of your app while users maintain custody of their own information—a cleaner architecture that happens to also be a simpler legal position.

For developers frustrated by the progressive closure of platform APIs, Seed Protocol represents a return to building on genuinely open systems. Users can publish permanently through your app. You can create custom identity schemas or integrate existing decentralized identity standards. Other developers can build on what you create, and you can build on their work. The only limit is your imagination—not an API rate limit, not a partnership agreement, not a platform's strategic decision to compete with its own ecosystem.
