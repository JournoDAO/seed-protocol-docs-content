# Writers

Seed Protocol gives writers something the internet promised but never delivered: true ownership of your published work. Whether you're journaling for yourself, building a newsletter audience, or writing professionally, your words are stored on permanent, decentralized infrastructure. No platform can unpublish you, no service discontinuation can scatter your archive, and no terms-of-service change can hold your content hostage. Your writing exists as long as Ethereum exists.

The versioning system built into the protocol means your creative process can be as visible or private as you choose. Drafts, revisions, and final versions all maintain their relationships—useful for writers who want to show their work, collaborate with editors, or simply maintain a personal archive that captures how a piece evolved. Links you share never break because a blogging platform pivoted to video or a hosting service stopped paying its bills. Your portfolio becomes genuinely permanent.

For writers building an audience, Seed Protocol's schema system creates discovery pathways that don't depend on algorithmic favor. When you structure your work using defined content models, readers interested in your themes, genres, or subjects can find you through the shape of your data itself. Combined with attestations—readers, editors, or fellow writers vouching for your work in ways that persist permanently alongside it—you're building a reputation that compounds over time and belongs entirely to you.
