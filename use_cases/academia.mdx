Seed Protocol offers researchers a fundamentally different approach to publishing and preserving scholarly work. Your papers, datasets, and research outputs are stored on Arweave—a decentralized, permanent storage layer—with attestations recorded on Ethereum. This means your work exists independently of any institution's infrastructure; it won't vanish if a university changes systems, a journal folds, or a hosting service discontinues. As long as Ethereum exists, your research remains discoverable and intact.

The protocol's schema-based data model creates unexpected opportunities for scholarly discovery. When you structure your research using defined models and properties, you're essentially speaking a shared language with other researchers. Someone studying the same methodology or phenomenon using compatible schemas becomes instantly visible to you—and you to them. Citations transform from static references into live, queryable connections that update as the underlying work evolves, creating a living web of scholarship rather than frozen footnotes.

Attestations provide a mechanism for peer verification that lives permanently alongside your content. When a colleague validates your findings or a reviewer endorses your methodology, that support becomes an immutable part of the record. This creates a transparent, auditable trail of scholarly engagement that can't be manipulated or erased – a censorship-resistant foundation for academic discourse.
