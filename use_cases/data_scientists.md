# Data scientists

Seed Protocol transforms how research data and analytical work persist and propagate. Every dataset, algorithm, and finding you publish benefits from built-in versioning—git-style history tracking at the data layer means collaborators across the globe can trace exactly how your work evolved, fork from specific versions, and merge improvements back. Important datasets never simply disappear because a company pivots or a grant ends; they're stored on infrastructure designed for permanence.

The schema system solves the discovery problem that plagues collaborative science. When you define your data models with Seed Protocol schemas, you're creating machine-readable contracts that describe your work's structure. Others using compatible schemas—whether modeling similar phenomena or consuming similar inputs—become immediately findable. Your findings reach their natural audience without relying on any platform's recommendation algorithm.

Perhaps most importantly, Seed Protocol eliminates platform risk from your research foundations. Building analytical pipelines on services that might deprecate features, change APIs, or shut down entirely has become an accepted hazard of modern data work. With decentralized storage and Ethereum-based attestations as your base layer, you're building on infrastructure with no single point of failure—thinking long-term becomes possible when your foundation isn't quicksand.
