# Why Seed Protocol?

Permanence is not just about storage of data, but also a flexibility to adapt to unknown future circumstances. Seed Protocol
allows different meaning to emerge from the same pieces of data as people, culture, and perceptions change.

When trying to conceive of a way to make content last into the future, one finds success likely means a deep humility
about one's ability to predict what the state of the world will be. Anything we think we know now may end up being wrong.
So rigid ideas around authorship and form factor are best left for the future to decide.

In Seed Protocol, the querier of the data determines the meaning, not the author. This alleviates the protocol from
solving verified authorship from a technical perspective.

Is the author of a blog post the person who pressed the publish button? That might be an assistant or an editor in a newsroom.

Is the author the person who controls the private key that signs the content? That key could be stolen or given away to someone else.

The best answer, we think, evades common sense because it is so unsatisfying and messy. The author is subjective, fluid, and local.

Without knowing the context of where a blog post will be read, or who will read it, or what their criteria are for
determining authorship â€¦ we're just shooting in the dark.

So what do we know now? We know that you want to publish your content. We know that you want your content to be around
for as long as you desire. We know that it doesn't make sense for the discoverability or longevity of your content to
be attached to the viability of businesses or the economy.

Seed Protocol atomizes your content and publishes it on the decentralized networks that are most likely to be around in
100 years or more. It does this knowing full well that the atomic pieces will likely be reconfigured and have completely
different meaning than what was intended. But the flexibility, the ability to be grown and changed over time, is exactly
why we think this design has staying power.

It begins from a deep suspicion about our own perspectives. It comes from an openness to being completely wrong about
everything. It accounts for the potential future where what we intended is exactly the opposite of what is understood
from our content. And yet we provide this digital dirt to be reformed by unknown hands into something that is useful,
or terrible, or beautiful. Because what else are we going to do?
